    				COLLECTIONS


1. What are the main differences between array and collection?

Array : 
	Arrays are fixed in size that is once we create an array we can not increased or decreased based on our requirement. 
	With respect to memory Arrays are not recommended to use.
	With respect to performance Arrays are recommended to use.
	Arrays can hold only homogeneous data types elements.
	There is no underlying data structure for arrays and hence ready made  method support is not available.
	Arrays can hold both object and primitive.

Collection :
	Collection are growable in nature that is based on our requirement. We can increase or decrease of size.
	With respect to memory collection are recommended to use.
	With respect to performance collection are not recommended to use.
	Collection can hold both homogeneous and and heterogeneous elements.
	Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure and 
	hence for every requirement ready made method support is available being a performance. 
	we can use these method directly and We are not responsible to implement these methods.
	Collection can hold only object types but primitive.




2. Explain various interfaces used in Collection framework?

	Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and 
	classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

3. What is the difference between ArrayList and Vector?
	
	Vector and ArrayList both uses Array internally as data structure. They are dynamically resizable. ...
	But, ArrayList increases by half of its size when its size is increased. 
	Therefore as per Java API the only main difference is,
	Vector's methods are synchronized and ArrayList's methods are not synchronized


4. What is the difference between ArrayList andLinkedList?
	
	ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements. 
	LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements. ... 
	LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.
	ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.
	
		
5. What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
	
	Iterator can traverse only in forward direction whereas 
	ListIterator traverses both in forward and backward directions.
	ListIterator can help to replace an element whereas Iterator cannot.



6. What is the difference between List and Set?
              List	     											      Set
	The list implementation allows us to add the same or duplicate elements.	        The set implementation doesn't allow us to add the same or duplicate elements.
	The insertion order is maintained by the List.	                                        It doesn't maintain the insertion order of elements.
	List allows us to add any number of null values.				        Set allows us to add at least one null value in it.
	The List implementation classes are LinkedList and ArrayList.			        The Set implementation classes are TreeSet, HashSet and LinkedHashSet.
	We can get the element of a specified index from the list using the get() method.	We cannot find the element from the Set based on the index because it doesn't provide any get method().
	It is used when we want to frequently access the elements by using the index.		It is used when we want to design a collection of distinct elements.
	The method of List interface listiterator() is used to iterate the List elements.	The iterator is used when we need to iterate the Set elements.



7. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?


	1	Hash set is implemented using HashTable 	        The tree set is implemented using a tree structure. 
	2	HashSet allows a null object 				The tree set does not allow the null object.
									 It throws the null pointer exception. 
	3	Hash set use equals method to compare two objects 	Tree set use compare method for comparing two objects. 
	4	Hash set doesn't now allow a heterogeneous object 	Tree set allows a heterogeneous object 
	5	HashSet does not maintain any order 			TreeSet maintains an object in sorted order 


	
8. What is the difference between HashSet andHashMap?

	Definition		Java HashMap is a hash table based implementation of Map interface.	HashSet is a Set. It creates a collection that uses a hash table for storage.
	Implementation		HashMap implements Map, Cloneable, and Serializable interface es.	HashSet implements Set, Cloneable, Serializable, Iterable and Collection interfaces.
	Stores			In HashMap we store a key-value pair. 
			It maintains the mapping of key and value.				In HashSet, we store objects.
	Duplicate values	It does not allow duplicate keys, but duplicate values are allowed.	It does not allow duplicate values.


9.What is the difference between HashMap andHashtable?


	HashMap is non-synchronized. It is not thread-safe and can’t be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code 
	whereas Hashtable is synchronized. It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads.
	HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values 
	whereas Hashtable doesn’t allow any null key or value.
	HashMap is generally preferred over HashTable if thread synchronization is not needed



10. What is the difference between Comparable and   Comparator?

		Comparable												Comparator
	1) Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. 
	In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.		The Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
	2) Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.						Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.
	3) Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.								Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.
	4) Comparable is present in java.lang package.										A Comparator is present in the java.util package.
	5) We can sort the list elements of Comparable type by Collections.sort(List) method.					We can sort the list elements of Comparator type by Collections.sort(List, Comparator) method.



11. How to synchronize List, Set and Map elements?

	ArrayList, HashSet and HashMap are three most frequently used data structures in java. 
	As they are most used, they are not synchronized for the sake of performance.
	
	java.util.Collections class. 
	Collections class is an utility class which has some useful methods provides synchronisation. 
	
	
12. What do you understand by fail-fast?

	Fail Fast : while we are iterating through an collection and trying to modify the structure of collection concurrently 
	structural modification like adding and removing data from collection this leads to concurrent modification exception 

	iterator in arraylist and hashmap are the example of fast fail iterator



13.What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?



	Basis		Array																ArrayList


	Definition	An array is a dynamically-created object.
 		It serves as a container that holds the constant number of values of the same type.
		It has a contiguous memory location.										The ArrayList is a class of Java Collections framework. It contains popular classes like Vector, HashTable, and HashMap.

	Static/ Dynamic Array is static in size.											ArrayList is dynamic in size.

	Resizable	An array is a fixed-length data structure.									ArrayList is a variable-length data structure. It can be resized itself when needed.
	

	Initialization	It is mandatory to provide the size of an array while initializing it directly or indirectly.			We can create an instance of ArrayList without specifying its size. Java creates ArrayList of default size.




14. How to remove duplicates from ArrayList?


	To remove the duplicates from a list, you can make use of the built-in function set(). 
	The specialty of the set() method is that it returns distinct elements.
	You can remove duplicates from the given list by importing OrderedDictfrom collections.



15. Write a Java program to copy one array list into another?

	In order to copy elements of ArrayList to another ArrayList,
	we use the Collections. copy() method. 
	It is used to copy all elements of a collection into another. 
	where src is the source list object and dest is the destination list object.

package com.demo;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;

public class LinkedListIterate {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<Integer>();
			list.add(56);
			list.add(25);
			list.add(64);
			list.add(25);
			list.add(12);
			list.add(53);
				
		System.out.println("Linked List : "+list);
	
		List<Integer> list1 = new ArrayList<Integer>(list);
		
		System.out.println("Array List : "+list1);
	}
}

Output:
Linked List : [56, 25, 64, 25, 12, 53]
Array List : [56, 25, 64, 25, 12, 53]




16. Write a Java program of swap two elements in an array list?

package com.practice.numberpgms;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;

public class ArrayCopy {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		int[] arr = { 10, 90, 89, 70, 67, 56, 34, 10, 90, 70, 89 };

		ArrayList<Integer> array = new ArrayList<Integer>();

		for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
			array.add(arr[i]);

		}
		System.out.println();

		Iterator<Integer> arrays = array.iterator();
		while (arrays.hasNext()) {
			System.out.println(arrays.next());

		}

		ArrayList<Integer> list = array;

		Iterator<Integer> lister = list.listIterator();

		System.out.println("Second list before iteration");
		while (lister.hasNext()) {
			System.out.println(lister.next());

		}

		System.out.println(list + "Before swaping the 2 numbers");
		Collections.swap(list, 0, 3);
		System.out.println("After swaping the 2 numbers" + list);

}

}


17. Write a Java program to iterate through all elements in a linked list starting at the specified position?



ListIterator<Integer> list1 = link.listIterator(3);
		
		link.addAll(0, array);

		while (list1.hasNext()) {
			System.out.println(list1.next());

		}



18. Write a Java program to get the first and last occurrence of the specified elements in a linked list ?


package com.demo;

import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;

public class LinkedListIterate {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<Integer>();
			list.add(56);
			list.add(25);
			list.add(64);
			list.add(25);
			list.add(12);
			list.add(53);
			
		
		System.out.println("First(Index) Occurance of 25 : "+list.lastIndexOf(25));
		System.out.println("Last(Index) Occurance of 25 : "+list.indexOf(25));
	
	}
}

Output:
First(Index) Occurance of 25 : 3
Last(Index) Occurance of 25 : 1





19. Write a Java program to retrieve but does not remove, the first element of a linked list ?


LinkedList<Integer> link = new LinkedList<Integer>();

		link.addAll(0, array);

		System.out.println(link.getFirst() + "First element of the linked list");




20. Write a Java program to convert a linked list to array list ?



LinkedList<Integer> link = new LinkedList<Integer>();

		link.addAll(0, array);


		ArrayList<Integer> ar = new ArrayList<Integer>(link);

		System.out.println("After converting into arraylist from linkedlist" + ar);
		
		ListIterator<Integer> list1 = ar.listIterator();

		while (list1.hasNext()) {
			System.out.println(list1.next());

		}

		System.out.println("All elements in the linked list");
